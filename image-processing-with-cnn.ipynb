The project focuses on the following key goals:\n\n1. **Data Augmentation** 🌟: Implement and apply various image manipulation techniques, including brightness and contrast adjustments, to enhance the dataset. This helps simulate different lighting conditions that a model may encounter in real-world scenarios.\n\n2. **Model Training and Evaluation** 🧠: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of images and evaluate its performance on both normal and manipulated test sets. The model will be trained on standard image data and then tested on images with altered lighting conditions to measure its robustness.\n\n3. **Comparison of Performance Across Test Sets** 📊: Assess and compare the model's accuracy across three distinct test sets:\n    - **Normal Test Set** 📸: The original unaltered images.\n    - **Manipulated Test Set** 🌅: Images with adjusted brightness and contrast to simulate real-world variability in lighting conditions.\n    - **White-Balanced Test Set** 🎨: Images that have undergone white-balancing adjustments to correct for lighting discrepancies.\n\n4. **Performance Analysis and Insights** 🔍: Analyze and interpret the results obtained from the different test sets. The goal is to understand how well the model generalizes to unseen lighting conditions and to identify areas for improvement, such as enhancing model robustness through further data augmentation or model optimization techniques.\n\nThis project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of image preprocessing and data augmentation in building more reliable and adaptable image classification models, especially for use cases involving varying real-world conditions.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1. Data Preparation: Handling Class Names from the Dataset 🗂️📸\n\nIn this step, we prepare the class names from the dataset for further processing. Specifically, we focus on organizing the class names by converting them to a consistent format.\n\n1. **Selecting Specific Classes**:\n   - We begin by defining a list of selected animal classes that we will be working with. These classes include various animals like `collie`, `dolphin`, `elephant`, `giant panda`, and others.\n\n2. **Defining the Dataset Directory**:\n   - We specify the directory where the images for each class are stored. In our case, the dataset is located in the `JPEGImages` folder, which contains a directory for each animal class.\n\n3. **Listing All Class Names**:\n   - Using the `os.listdir()` function, we retrieve all the folder names from the dataset directory. Each folder name corresponds to a different animal class in the dataset.\n\n4. **Cleaning and Standardizing Class Names**:\n   - We then process the class names to ensure consistency:\n     - All class names are converted to lowercase to maintain uniformity (e.g., \"Elephant\" becomes \"elephant\").\n     - Additionally, any `+` characters in the class names are replaced with a space, which ensures proper formatting (e.g., \"giant+panda\" becomes \"giant panda\").\n\n5. **Displaying the Cleaned Class Names**:\n   - Finally, the cleaned class names are printed to verify that all the names have been processed correctly.\n\nThis step is essential for ensuring that the class names are in a clean and consistent format, making it easier to handle the data during further steps in the project.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\n\n# Selected classes\nselected_classes = ['collie', 'dolphin', 'elephant', 'fox', 'moose', \n                    'rabbit', 'sheep', 'squirrel', 'giant panda', 'polar bear']\n\n# Directory where the dataset is located\ndataset_dir = '/kaggle/input/animals-with-attributes-2/Animals_with_Attributes2/JPEGImages'\n\n# Get all class directories\nall_classes = os.listdir(dataset_dir)\n\n# Convert all class names to lowercase and replace '+' with space\nall_classes_lower = [class_name.replace('+', ' ').lower() for class_name in all_classes]\n\nprint(\"All class names:\", all_classes_lower)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-21T11:49:42.780655Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-21T11:49:42.780990Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-21T11:49:42.810880Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-21T11:49:42.780950Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-21T11:49:42.810154Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"All class names: ['fox', 'wolf', 'horse', 'antelope', 'hamster', 'skunk', 'chimpanzee', 'lion', 'otter', 'giant panda', 'raccoon', 'hippopotamus', 'bobcat', 'pig', 'rat', 'spider monkey', 'buffalo', 'mouse', 'tiger', 'bat', 'grizzly bear', 'gorilla', 'dalmatian', 'killer whale', 'siamese cat', 'humpback whale', 'chihuahua', 'beaver', 'polar bear', 'german shepherd', 'elephant', 'sheep', 'collie', 'moose', 'zebra', 'seal', 'cow', 'ox', 'mole', 'rabbit', 'giraffe', 'persian cat', 'rhinoceros', 'dolphin', 'blue whale', 'squirrel', 'leopard', 'deer', 'weasel', 'walrus']\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.1 Correcting and Matching Selected Class Names with Dataset Directories 🔄📁\n\n1. **Convert the names of selected classes to lowercase and replace '+' with spaces**:\n   - This step ensures that the class names from `selected_classes` match the formatted class names in the dataset directory (`all_classes_lower`).

Training the Model 🏋️‍♂️\n\nIn this section, we train the model using the `fit()` method and apply real-time data augmentation with `ImageDataGenerator`. We also use the `EarlyStopping` callback to stop training early if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve over a set number of epochs, preventing overfitting and optimizing training efficiency. ⏱️\n\n### Key Elements of the Code:\n\n1. **EarlyStopping Callback ⏸️:**\n   - The `EarlyStopping` callback is used to monitor the model’s validation loss (`val_loss`) during training.\n   - `monitor='val_loss'`: The validation loss is tracked to detect when the model stops improving.\n   - `patience=5`: The training will stop after 5 epochs without improvement in the validation loss.\n   - `restore_best_weights=True`: Ensures that the model’s weights are restored to the best state when the validation loss was the lowest.\n\n2. **Data Augmentation 🔄:**\n   - The `datagen.flow()` function generates batches of image data with augmentation applied, improving the model’s ability to generalize by introducing variations in the training images.\n   - Batch size is set to 32, meaning the model will update its weights after processing 32 images at a time.\n\n3. **Model Training 🧑‍💻:**\n   - The model is trained for up to 30 epochs, but due to early stopping, it may stop earlier if no improvement is seen.\n   - The training process is monitored with `verbose=2` to display progress after every epoch.\n   - The validation data (`X_test`, `y_test_one_hot`) is used to evaluate the model after each epoch.\n\nThis setup ensures that the model is trained efficiently with the possibility of early termination if no further improvement is observed, thus optimizing the time spent on training while also avoiding overfitting. ⚡\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n\n# EarlyStopping

A value greater than 1.0 increases the contrast, while a value less than 1.0 reduces it.\n  - **`beta`**: Controls the brightness of the image. A positive value increases the brightness, and a negative value decreases it.\n  \n  The function scales the pixel values of the image by the `alpha` factor (contrast adjustment) and adds a constant value `beta` (brightness adjustment). 🌟\n\n- **Loop 🔁**:\n  - The code iterates over all the images in the input `images` list (which contains the test set images in this case).\n  - For each image, it applies the contrast and brightness adjustments and stores the manipulated image in the `manipulated_images` list.\n\n- **`manipulated_images`**:\n  - After applying the transformations, the list `manipulated_images` contains all the modified images, which are returned as a NumPy array. 📸\n\n- **Saving Manipulated Images 💾**:\n  - The manipulated images are saved as `.png` files with filenames like `manipulated_image_{idx}.png`, where `{idx}` is the index of the image in the manipulated list.\n  - This step is optional and can be omitted if saving the images is not necessary.\n\n### Result:\n- The resulting images will have adjusted brightness and contrast, which can be useful for augmenting the dataset or testing the model under different image conditions. 🌈\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_manipulated_images(images, alpha=1.5, beta=30):\n    manipulated_images = []\n    for img in images:\n        # Adjusting the brightness and contrast of the image\n        manipulated = cv2.convertScaleAbs(img, alpha=1.2, beta=10)\n        manipulated_images.append(manipulated)\n    return np.array(manipulated_images)\n\n# Manipulating the images in the test set\nmanipulated_test_images = get_manipulated_images(X_test)\n\n# Saving the manipulated images to files (optional)\nfor idx, img in enumerate(manipulated_test_images):\n    cv2.imwrite(f\"manipulated_image_{idx}.png\", img)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-21T13:52:13.523920Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-21T13:52:13.524359Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-21T13:52:16.037471Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-21T13:52:13.524323Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-21T13:52:16.036702Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 6.

These are used to calculate the loss and accuracy during evaluation.\n  - **`verbose=2`**: This argument controls the verbosity of the output. A value of 2 will display a progress bar and additional details during evaluation. 📊\n  \n  The `evaluate` function returns the model's loss and accuracy on the manipulated test images. The loss is the value of the loss function, and the accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions. 🎯\n\n- **`manipulated_test_results[1]`**:\n  - After the evaluation, `manipulated_test_results` stores a list where the first element is the loss value, and the second element is the accuracy value.\n  - `manipulated_test_results[1]` refers to the accuracy value of the model on the manipulated test set. 📈\n\n- **`print(f\"Manipüle Edilmiş Test Seti Başarı Oranı: {manipulated_test_results[1]*100:.2f}%\")`**:\n  - This line prints the accuracy of the model on the manipulated test set in percentage format. 📑\n  - The accuracy is multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage, and the result is formatted to two decimal places using `:.2f`. 🔢\n\n### Result:\n- After running this code, the model's accuracy on the manipulated test set will be displayed as a percentage.

Applying White Balance with the Gray World Algorithm ⚖️\n\nThe following code implements the **Gray World** algorithm, which is commonly used for white balance adjustment in images. The Gray World algorithm assumes that the average color of a scene is neutral (gray), and adjusts the image so that the average color values across the red, green, and blue channels are balanced. 🎨\n\n### Code Explanation:\n\n#### `gray_world(image)` function:\n\n- **Input**: \n    - The function takes an image in the form of a NumPy array where the three channels (Red, Green, and Blue) are stored in the last dimension. 📸\n\n- **Process**: \n    - The function first calculates the average values of the **Blue**, **Green**, and **Red** channels (`avg_b`, `avg_g`, and `avg_r` respectively).\n    - It then computes the overall average color value (`avg_gray`), which is the mean of the three channel averages.\n    - Each channel is then scaled by the ratio of the overall average color value to its corresponding average channel value. This process adjusts the color balance. 🔄\n\n- **Output**: \n    - The adjusted image is clipped to ensure that pixel values remain within the valid range [0, 255], and the result is converted back to the uint8 format for proper display. 🎥\n\n#### `get_wb_images(images)` function:\n\n- **Input**: \n    - A list of images (`images`) that needs to be processed with the Gray World algorithm. 🖼️\n\n- **Process**: \n    - This function iterates over all images in the input list, applying the `gray_world()` function to each image. 🔄\n\n- **Output**: \n    - The function returns an array of white-balanced images. 📤\n\n### Applying White Balance to the Manipulated Test Images:\n\n- **`wb_test_images = get_wb_images(manipulated_test_images)`**:\n    - This line applies the **Gray World** algorithm to the `manipulated_test_images`. The function `get_wb_images()` is called, which processes the manipulated images and adjusts their color balance using the Gray World algorithm. 🎨\n    - The result is stored in the `wb_test_images` variable, which can be used for further analysis or model evaluation. 📊\n\nThis technique helps to remove unwanted color casts and improves the overall appearance of images, especially in cases where the lighting conditions are not ideal. 🌅\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def gray_world(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function that applies white balance using the Gray World algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = np.zeros_like(image, dtype=np.float32)\n    avg_b = np.mean(image[:, :, 0])  # Average of the Blue channel\n    avg_g = np.mean(image[:, :, 1])  # Average of the Green channel\n    avg_r = np.mean(image[:, :, 2])  # Average of the Red channel\n    \n    # Normalizing the average values\n    avg_gray = (avg_b + avg_g + avg_r) / 3\n    \n    result[:, :, 0] = (image[:, :, 0] * (avg_gray / avg_b))  # Blue channel correction\n    result[:, :, 1] = (image[:, :, 1] * (avg_gray / avg_g))  # Green channel correction\n    result[:, :, 2] = (image[:, :, 2] * (avg_gray / avg_r))  # Red channel correction\n    \n    return np.clip(result, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)  # Convert the image back to uint8 format\n\ndef get_wb_images(images):\n    wb_images = []\n    for img in images:\n        result = gray_world(img)  # Apply the Gray World algorithm\n        wb_images.append(result)\n    return np.array(wb_images)\n\n# Applying color constancy to the manipulated test set\nwb_test_images = get_wb_images(manipulated_test_images)  # Apply white balance on manipulated test images\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-21T13:58:37.246700Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-21T13:58:37.247426Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-21T13:58:38.634297Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-21T13:58:37.247390Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-21T13:58:38.633581Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 8.

Below are some potential reasons for this performance gap and steps that could be taken to improve it.\n\n1. **Generalization Issues in the Model 🧠:**\n   The drastic decrease in performance on the manipulated and white-balanced test sets indicates that the model struggles to generalize well under different lighting and contrast conditions. This suggests that the model may have overfitted to the specific conditions present in the training data and isn't robust to variations.\n\n2. **Shift in Data Distribution 📊:**\n   The manipulated images likely introduced a shift in data distribution that the model wasn't trained on. As a result, the model's ability to recognize patterns in these altered images decreased significantly, showing its sensitivity to changes in the visual properties of the input.\n\n#### Potential Solutions 🛠️:\n\n1. **Data Augmentation 🌈:**\n   - To make the model more robust, I could incorporate more aggressive data augmentation techniques during training, including random brightness, contrast adjustments, and even white-balancing operations. This would help the model learn to adapt to various lighting conditions and increase its generalization capability.\n\n2. **Fine-Tuning the Model 🔧:**\n   - Another approach could be to fine-tune the model on a set of manipulated images with different lighting conditions. By retraining or fine-tuning with these variations, the model could better understand the potential changes in image properties.\n\n3. **Regularization Techniques 🧘‍♂️:**\n   - Adding more regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization could help the model avoid overfitting to the specific features of the training data and improve its performance on unseen data, including manipulated test sets.\n\n4. **Using Pretrained Models 🤖:**\n   - Another solution could be to leverage a pretrained model (such as one based on ImageNet) and fine-tune it on my dataset. Pretrained models often have better generalization capabilities due to their exposure to diverse data during initial training.\n\n5. **Adjusting the Learning Rate ⚙️:**\n   - I could experiment with different learning rates or use learning rate schedules to ensure that the model converges better and isn't too sensitive to overfitting.\n\n#### Conclusion 📈:\n\nThe results show that the model performs well on the normal test set, but struggles significantly on manipulated and white-balanced sets. Incorporating more diverse data, applying robust augmentation, and tuning the model further should improve its performance across varying conditions, helping the model become more adaptable to real-world variations.\n","metadata":{}}]}
